https://projects.spring.io/spring-data/[Spring Data Commons] is part of the umbrella Spring Data project that provides shared infrastructure across the Spring Data projects. It contains technology neutral repository interfaces as well as a metadata model for persisting Java classes.

Our primary goals are:

* Powerful Repository and custom object-mapping abstractions
* Support for cross-store persistence
* Dynamic query generation from query method names
* Implementation domain base classes providing basic properties
* Support for transparent auditing (created, last changed)
* Possibility to integrate custom repository code
* Easy Spring integration with custom namespace

Having trouble with Spring Data? We’d love to help!

* Check the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/[reference documentation], and https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/[Javadocs].
* Learn the Spring basics – Spring Data builds on Spring Framework, check the https://spring.io[spring.io] web-site for a wealth of reference documentation.
If you are just starting out with Spring, try one of the https://spring.io/guides[guides].
* If you are upgrading, check out the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/releases[GitHub releases] and the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/wiki#release-notes[release notes] for "`new and noteworthy`" features.
* Ask a question - we monitor https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow.com] for questions tagged with https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-data[`spring-data`].
You can also chat with the community on https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data[Gitter].
* Report bugs with Spring Data Commons at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/issues[github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/issues].

== Reporting Issues

Spring Data uses GitHub as issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please search the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/issues[issue tracker] to see if someone has already reported the problem.
* If the issue doesn’t already exist, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/issues/new[create a new issue].
* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know the version of Spring Data that you are using and JVM version.
* If you need to paste code, or include a stack trace use Markdown +++```+++ escapes before and after your text.
* If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. Attach a link to your code or a compressed file containing your code.

== Building from Source

You don’t need to build from source to use Spring Data (binaries in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Data can be easily built with the https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper].
You also need JDK 17 or above.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install
----

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Maven v3.5.0 or above].

_Also see link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] if you wish to submit pull requests, and in particular please sign the https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor’s Agreement] before your first non-trivial change._

=== Building reference documentation

Building the documentation builds also the project without running tests.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install -Pdistribute
----

The generated documentation is available from `target/site/reference/html/index.html`.
