= Null Handling of Repository Methods

As of Spring Data 2.0, repository CRUD methods that return an individual aggregate instance use Java 8's `Optional` to indicate the potential absence of a value.
Besides that, Spring Data supports returning the following wrapper types on query methods:

* `com.google.common.base.Optional`
* `scala.Option`
* `io.vavr.control.Option`

Alternatively, query methods can choose not to use a wrapper type at all.
The absence of a query result is then indicated by returning `null`.
Repository methods returning collections, collection alternatives, wrappers, and streams are guaranteed never to return `null` but rather the corresponding empty representation.
See "`xref:repositories/query-return-types-reference.adoc[Repository query return types]`" for details.

== Nullability Annotations

You can express nullability constraints for repository methods by using {spring-framework-docs}/core/null-safety.html[Spring Framework's nullability annotations].
They provide a tooling-friendly approach and opt-in `null` checks during runtime, as follows:

* {spring-framework-javadoc}/org/springframework/lang/NonNullApi.html[`@NonNullApi`]: Used on the package level to declare that the default behavior for parameters and return values is, respectively, neither to accept nor to produce `null` values.
* {spring-framework-javadoc}/org/springframework/lang/NonNull.html[`@NonNull`]: Used on a parameter or return value that must not be `null` (not needed on a parameter and return value where `@NonNullApi` applies).
* {spring-framework-javadoc}/org/springframework/lang/Nullable.html[`@Nullable`]: Used on a parameter or return value that can be `null`.

Spring annotations are meta-annotated with https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305[JSR 305] annotations (a dormant but widely used JSR).
JSR 305 meta-annotations let tooling vendors (such as https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/nullable-and-notnull-annotations.html[IDEA], https://help.eclipse.org/latest/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-using_external_null_annotations.htm[Eclipse], and link:https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#null-safety-and-platform-types[Kotlin]) provide null-safety support in a generic way, without having to hard-code support for Spring annotations.

NOTE: Spring Data can evaluate link:https://jspecify.dev/[JSpecify] annotations to determine nullability rules.0 JSpecify is still in development and might experience slight changes.

To enable runtime checking of nullability constraints for query methods, you need to activate non-nullability on the package level by using Springâ€™s `@NonNullApi` in `package-info.java`, as shown in the following example:

.Declaring Non-nullability in `package-info.java`
[source,java]
----
@org.springframework.lang.NonNullApi
package com.acme;
----

Once non-null defaulting is in place, repository query method invocations get validated at runtime for nullability constraints.
If a query result violates the defined constraint, an exception is thrown.
This happens when the method would return `null` but is declared as non-nullable (the default with the annotation defined on the package in which the repository resides).
If you want to opt-in to nullable results again, selectively use `@Nullable` on individual methods.
Using the result wrapper types mentioned at the start of this section continues to work as expected: an empty result is translated into the value that represents absence.

The following example shows a number of the techniques just described:

.Using different nullability constraints
[source,java]
----
package com.acme;                                                       <1>

import org.springframework.lang.Nullable;

interface UserRepository extends Repository<User, Long> {

  User getByEmailAddress(EmailAddress emailAddress);                    <2>

  @Nullable
  User findByEmailAddress(@Nullable EmailAddress emailAdress);          <3>

  Optional<User> findOptionalByEmailAddress(EmailAddress emailAddress); <4>
}
----
<1> The repository resides in a package (or sub-package) for which we have defined non-null behavior.
<2> Throws an `EmptyResultDataAccessException` when the query does not produce a result.
Throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when the `emailAddress` handed to the method is `null`.
<3> Returns `null` when the query does not produce a result.
Also accepts `null` as the value for `emailAddress`.
<4> Returns `Optional.empty()` when the query does not produce a result.
Throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when the `emailAddress` handed to the method is `null`.

[[repositories.nullability.kotlin]]
== Nullability in Kotlin-based Repositories

Kotlin has the definition of https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html[nullability constraints] baked into the language.
Kotlin code compiles to bytecode, which does not express nullability constraints through method signatures but rather through compiled-in metadata.
Make sure to include the `kotlin-reflect` JAR in your project to enable introspection of Kotlin's nullability constraints.
Spring Data repositories use the language mechanism to define those constraints to apply the same runtime checks, as follows:

.Using nullability constraints on Kotlin repositories
[source,kotlin]
----
interface UserRepository : Repository<User, String> {

  fun findByUsername(username: String): User     <1>

  fun findByFirstname(firstname: String?): User? <2>
}
----
<1> The method defines both the parameter and the result as non-nullable (the Kotlin default).
The Kotlin compiler rejects method invocations that pass `null` to the method.
If the query yields an empty result, an `EmptyResultDataAccessException` is thrown.
<2> This method accepts `null` for the `firstname` parameter and returns `null` if the query does not produce a result.
