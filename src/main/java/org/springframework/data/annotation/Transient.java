/**
 * Marks a field to be transient for the mapping framework. Thus, the property will not be persisted.
 * <p>
 * Excluding properties from the persistence mechanism is separate from Java's {@code transient} keyword that serves the
 * purpose of excluding properties from being serialized through Java Serialization.
 * <p>
 * Transient properties can be used in {@link PersistenceCreator constructor creation/factory methods}, however they
 * will use Java default values. We highly recommend using {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value
 * SpEL expressions through @Value(â€¦)} to provide a meaningful value.
