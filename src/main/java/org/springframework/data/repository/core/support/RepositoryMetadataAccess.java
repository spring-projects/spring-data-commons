/**
 * Marker for repository fragment implementation that intend to access repository method invocation metadata.
 * <p>
 * Note that this is a marker interface in the style of {@link java.io.Serializable}, semantically applying to a
 * fragment implementation class. In other words, this marker applies to a particular repository composition that
 * enables metadata access for the repository proxy when the composition contain fragments implementing this interface.
 * <p>
 * Ideally, in a repository composition only the fragment implementation uses this interface while the fragment
 * interface does not.
