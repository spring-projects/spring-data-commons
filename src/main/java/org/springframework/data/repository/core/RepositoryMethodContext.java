 * method metadata (not the default). It returns the invoked repository method. Target objects or advice can use this to
 * make advised calls.
 * <p>
 * Spring Data's framework does not expose method metadata by default, as there is a performance cost in doing so.

 * The functionality in this class might be used by a target object that needed access to resources on the invocation.
 * However, this approach should not be used when there is a reasonable alternative, as it makes application code
 * dependent on usage in particular.
