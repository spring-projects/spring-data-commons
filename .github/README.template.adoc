https://projects.spring.io/spring-data/[Spring Data Commons] is part of the umbrella Spring Data project that provides shared infrastructure across the Spring Data projects. It contains technology neutral repository interfaces as well as a metadata model for persisting Java classes.

Our primary goals are:

* Powerful Repository and custom object-mapping abstractions
* Support for cross-store persistence
* Dynamic query generation from query method names
* Implementation domain base classes providing basic properties
* Support for transparent auditing (created, last changed)
* Possibility to integrate custom repository code
* Easy Spring integration with custom namespace
